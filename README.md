# Routing for Fun

This is the culmination of work done for a presentation called, "Routing for Driving Pleasure."  It contains a set of scripts and a presentation (in .odp format) which offers some instructions on how to setup a routing dataset and find the "fun" roads.

# Recommended Software

* All the development was done on Linux, however, almost all of the rest of the software here will run fine on Windows.
* Quantum GIS (QGIS) desktop for visualizing the output and using the .qgs file.
* PostgreSQL 9.1 or newer.
* PostGIS 2.1 or newer.
* The point-to-point routing script is written in Python 3. ``requirement.txt`` lists the two required packages
    * psycopg2 for database connectivity
    * click for sane command line parsing.
